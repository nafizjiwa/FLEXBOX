Explain flexbox and its components.

Flexbox a tool that simplifies how to position elements and change postions especially if there are positioning issues. 
Two components of flexbox are flex containers and flex itms.
A flex container is an element on a page that contains flex items. 
All direct child elements of a flex container are flex items.
There are properties in flexbox some properties apply to flex containers while others apply to flex items.
To designate an ELEMENT as a flex container, set the elementâ€™s display property to flex or inline-flex. 
```elementName {```
```        display: flex/ in-line; ```
```}```
Flex container properties specify how its children behave.
